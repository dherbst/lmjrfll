# The Expo Day
The expo day has been traditionally held at a school or other location in Lower Merion Township. Teams usually consist of between two and six children. During the course of a few months, the children will research the US First challenge, create a poster, and create a Lego model to present at the Expo Day.

During the Expo Day, the teams will present their poster and model to a panel of two to four judges and answer some questions about their research, poster, and model. At the conclusion of the expo the judges will present awards to the teams.

A typical Expo Day follows an example schedule:

 * 8:30am - 9:00am: Check-in for table assignment and set up your table with your poster and model
 * 9:00am - 11:30am: Team judging and activities*
 * 11:30am-12:00pm: Award ceremony

** The LMSD tech club and DAWGMA robotics club students usually participate in the day with some demonstrations and activities related to math, technology, and science.
